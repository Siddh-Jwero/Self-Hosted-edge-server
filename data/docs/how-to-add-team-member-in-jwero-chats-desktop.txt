To add a new team member in Jwero Chats, follow these steps:

Go to the Team Management page at https://chats.jwero.ai/settings/team-management and click on "Add Team Member."

Set up the applicable access for the team member by clicking on the team member’s name to assign access.

Choose the access level: Allow All, Certain Access, or Restrict entire access for particular sections of the platform.

Note the user limits based on your plan:

Up to 3 users (including admins) for the Jwero Chats Pro Plan

Up to 5 users (including admins) for the Jwero Chats Plus Plan

After adding the team member, the admin can assign contacts either manually or in bulk.

Required information to add a team member includes: team member name (or common account name), email address, and contact number.
